// The HTML DOM is an accepted guideline for how to access, update, add
// or remove HTML elements.
// A Structure representation of an HTML document is provided by DOM.
// An HTML document is completely built using objects. DOM represents it in an 
// objected-oriented way which can be manipulated using scripting languages like 
// javascript.
// All the objects in the HTML document are hierarchically connected to one another. 
// The document object forms the root of all objects.

// There are three kinds of objects:

// Core object (aray,math,etc)
// User defined object(myobject,student,employee,etc)
// Host object(h1,document,p,etc)
